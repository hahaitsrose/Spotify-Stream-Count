# Spotify-Stream-Count
A simple way to retrieve unfiltered playcounts for Spotify.

# How?
Simply download the zip file of all of the code, enter the link of the Album or Track you wish to find the playcount for, and then enter whether it is an Album or Track, and your data will be returned in a string!

# Prerequisites
If not already installed, you must use pip to install the json and requests libaries. Both are used in this project.

# The Future
I  will most likely update this repository in the future with new features as requested.
