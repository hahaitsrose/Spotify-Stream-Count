# Spotify-Stream-Count
A simple way to retrieve unfiltered playcounts for Spotify.

# How?
Simply download the zip file of all of the code, enter the link of the Album or Track you wish to find the playcount for, and your data will be returned in a string!

# Prerequisites
If not already installed, you must use pip to install the json, requests, and pyotp libaries. All are used in this project. You must also have a recent version of Python installed on your device.

# sp_dc Cookie
In your settings.json file, you must put your sp_dc cookie retrieved from the developer tools in the Spotify Web Player website. If you inspect element and go to the cookie seciton, you should be able to find the cookie.

# The Future
I  will most likely update this repository in the future with new features as requested.
